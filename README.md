# Footprint Report App
The Footprint Report App is a React-based web application designed to calculate and visualize carbon emissions. It provides users with insights into their activities' environmental impact and suggests ways to reduce emissions.

# Features
- User-Friendly Calculator: Calculate emissions based on user input for various activities.
- Interactive Visualizations: Display data in charts (e.g., bar charts) for better understanding.
- Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices.

# Technologies Used
- React: Frontend library.
- Styled Components: For styling.
- MobX: State management.
- GraphQL and Apollo: For API integration.
- React Flow: For visualizing data flow diagrams.
- Recharts or Chart.js: For interactive data visualizations.
- Nx: For workspace management.

# Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (>= 16.x)
npm or yarn package manager

## Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rociodloa/footprint-report
cd footprint-report

# Usage
Navigate to the calculator page to input your activity details (e.g., transportation, energy usage).
View your results on the results page, including suggestions to lower emissions.
Explore the data flow diagram for a visual representation of the application's data handling.

# Future Enhancements
- Integration with live environmental data APIs.
- User authentication for saving results.
- Localization for multi-language support.
- Contributing
- We welcome contributions to improve the app.
- Theming Support: Styled with Styled Components for light/dark themes.
- State Management: Uses MobX for efficient global state management.
- GraphQL Integration: Fetch and manage data dynamically with Apollo and GraphQL.
- Data Flow Diagram: Visualize data flow using React Flow.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
